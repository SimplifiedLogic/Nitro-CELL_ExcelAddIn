# Excel Add-In for Nitro-CELL Execution Worksheets


Nitro-CELL is a commercial automation application for PTC's Creo Parametric.

Nitro-CELL uses Excel Workbooks to capture the design, documentation, logic, data and automation steps required to transform inputs into results.

Execution Worksheets are Nitro-CELL generated/formatted Excel Worksheets that can be used to document the execution steps and process that will be performed in Creo Parametric. (e.g. erase memory, open models, set parameters, regenerate, etc.).

Execution Worksheets are the foundation of Nitro-CELL, and there are many commands and options in Nitro-CELL that can be used to perform/obtain the desired results in Creo Parametric.

This Excel Add-In was created to improve the usability of Nitro-CELL specific to Execution Worksheets.  Basically to present context-sensitive help about Nitro-CELL commands and options in Excel Cells when selected by a user.
